# Serverless AI Content Pipeline Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation and Data Ingestion (A2A)
In this phase, you will build the system's foundation, focusing on automated and decoupled information collection.

**Objective**: Collect data from external sources and store it for future processing.

### Step 1.1: Configure Base Infrastructure

- Create a code repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) for the project.
- Set up a cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
- Create an S3 Bucket (or similar, like Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage) to store raw data.

### Step 1.2: Develop Data Collection Function

Create the first Lambda function (or Azure Function/Google Cloud Function).

Implement the following logic in the function code:
- Make requests to news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, blog RSS feeds).
- Process received data (e.g., extract title, body, and URL).
- Save content in JSON files in the S3 Bucket you created.

### Step 1.3: Automate Execution (A2A)

Configure a scheduled event (using Amazon EventBridge or similar) to trigger your data collection Lambda at regular intervals (e.g., every 1 hour).

## Phase 2: Context Pipeline (RAG)
Here, you will transform raw data into a knowledge base for the AI model.

**Objective**: Generate vector representations (embeddings) of collected data for context queries.

### Step 2.1: Configure Vector Database

- Choose a vector database provider (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB, or an OpenSearch cluster).
- Create a collection/index to store embeddings and metadata.

### Step 2.2: Develop Processing Function (RAG)

Create a second Lambda Function:
- Configure it to be triggered by a file creation event in the S3 Bucket (this is the A2A concept in action).

Implement the following logic in this function:
- Read the newly added JSON file from S3.
- Send the text to an embedding model (OpenAI API, Cohere, Bedrock, etc.) to generate vectors.
- Save the generated vector, along with the title and URL, in your vector database.

## Phase 3: Agent and Publication (MCP)
In this stage, the project comes to life. You will create the AI agent that orchestrates content generation and publication.

**Objective**: Orchestrate the text generation and publication process using an AI agent.

### Step 3.1: Create and Configure AI Agent

Choose a platform to create your agent (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Agents for Amazon Bedrock).

Define the tools that the agent can use. These are the MCP calls:
- RAG Search Tool: A tool that receives a query topic and performs a similarity search in your vector database, returning relevant context.
- Publication Tool: A tool that receives text and publishes it on a platform (e.g., a blog API, email service, or social media API).

### Step 3.2: Develop Agent Logic (MCP)

Implement the main logic (the "prompt" or "instruction") that the agent should follow, for example:

"Be a news editor. Your task is to search for the 3 most recent technology news items in our knowledge base. Use the 'rag_search' tool for this. Based on the retrieved content, generate a brief summary to be published on the blog. Use the 'publish_content' tool to send the summary."

### Step 3.3: Integrate Agent with Workflow

Create the third Lambda Function:
- Configure it to be triggered by an EventBridge event (or similar) indicating that phase 2 has been completed (or at a different scheduled time for publication).
- The code of this function will call your AI agent to start the generation and publication process.

## Phase 4: Testing, Monitoring, and Improvement

### End-to-End Testing
Run the complete flow, from scheduling to publication, and verify that the generated content is relevant and the process occurs without errors.

### Monitoring
Use CloudWatch or monitoring tools to observe Lambda functions, logs, and costs.

### Iteration
Start with a simple prototype and then add complexity, such as:
- Support for more data sources
- Ability to generate content in different formats (long articles, tweets, newsletters)
- An approval system to review generated content before publication

This plan provides a clear and modular roadmap. You can focus on one phase at a time and ensure each component works correctly before moving on to the next.
